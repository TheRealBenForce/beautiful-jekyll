One of the main reasons why I've launched my blog is to highlight all the bullies (and heroes) of the world. The people that think that they can so and do anything without any real consequences. And what better way to mark the entry of my first 'bullies' category, Donald Trump.

As a child who spent summers with an Italian familiy at the New Jersey shore, Donald Trump was idolized. I would eat in his buffets. I remember the summer The Taj Mahal opened. I though it was amazingly beautiful and exotic. The name itself, Trump, installed illusions of wealth, luck, and fortune. No wonder he has made so much money on the Trump brand.

I often find myself asking 'What happens to these'people after they have that moment where the world sees them for what they really are?' Who knows'what lies are in Donald Trump's future (or his past). Personally, I think after the dust settles, Trump will find a way to profit from'his own demise. I imagine he will lose the presidency race'with some shocking revelations possibly criminal in nature, ruin his brand, slip away into oblivion for 'a decade or so before having someone ghost writing another book for him and leaking a sex tape the month before it comes out. This week, he had that moment that will begin that excited downward spiral.

This is a man who is not sorry for his abhorrent comments and inappropriate actions involving'women' and for that matter minorities, foreigners, the disabled, veterans, the overweight, the poor, celebrities, children. Who knows, maybe even someday he would make fun of me, if I were to be so lucky. All of these are potential tax paying citizens, which actually there is no proof that Donald Trump has done and significant reports suggesting that he hasn't.

I can go on and on about the things he has said and done. [This is a nice running list of twitter comments alone](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html). I actually feel a little bad posting this, because Donald Trump 'shows many signs that he suffers from severe mental disabilities. But I must come to terms that if I continue this series, it may mean I have to cross that line. I've always considered myself an Anti-Bully, and this is a new pathway for me.

Donald Trump, I crown you, 'The King of all Bullies'. Now I must go watch Hillary Clinton and Anderson Cooper continue to destroy you on national television.
