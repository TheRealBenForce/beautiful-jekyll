I've decided this year from here forward, I will refuse to acknowledge the second Monday of October as 'Christopher Columbus' day. I encourage everybody to read a little bit about it.

Think about it. We are supposed to celebrate some guy that 'discovered' America, a place where people already lived! And then my ancestors' just take their land and make a holiday for it? Columbus never even landed in North America! The day was created by Italian Americans by political lobbyists. The one redeeming quality is that it was, in a way, used as a tool to remind non-Italian Americans that the Italian Americans (who were being persecuted at the time) had a 400 year history in the new world.

Columbus Day sucks and I'm never going to talk about it again.

'OK Google, remind me October 7th, 'Don't talk about that stupid holiday''.
