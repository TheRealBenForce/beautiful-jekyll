I have long theorized Facebook has a mission to create a profile on every living person on the planet whether they have signed up for sites or not. The reason to create a "hidden" profile on non subscribed users is so that when they do formally sign up, highly targeted adds can be directed to them immediately, even before the new user formally provides much information.

What happens behind the scenes is that Facebook uses facial recognition of people in every photo uploaded to the platform. Facebook knows who in the photo is subscribed and who isn't even if they are not formally tagged. A few data points act as the unsubscribed signature of a person, relying in large part on the face. Probability scores are assigned to each data point that can be gleaned from where you've been seen and in whose photos. Age, zip of home, interests based on interests of likely friends and family, etc.

Once a new user uploads a photo to the platform, Facebook correlates you to their hidden profile and inmediately can send you ads using their algorithms for your assumed interests and lifestyle. Then as the information is provided by the true user, the probability scores are overwritten with provided data and the algorithm is further refined.
