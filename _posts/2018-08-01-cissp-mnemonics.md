I've disappeared for awhile. Been a bit busy with school and then I went heads down into CISSP study prep. I did pass the test and I'm waiting on the review by ISC2. Overall, I didn't enjoy this test at all. I found a lot of the subject matter antiquated. In any case, some of it was quite difficult to study for and you must rely on mnemonics. [I documented some of mine in a repo](https://github.com/TheRealBenForce/cissp-mnemonics) to share. I hope this helps.
