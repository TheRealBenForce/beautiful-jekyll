Hi, my name is Ben Force. That is my real name. I like nerdy things such
as video games, cloud computing, and fish keeping.

### My blog
This is a serverless static website built on Amazon S3, secured with Amazon Certificate Manager and distributed with CloudFront fronted by Route53. It's built from CloudFormation available in my [github repo s3plus](https://github.com/TheRealBenForce/s3plus).

The blog framework is Jekyll using the [beautiful-jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

### My crazy professional history
I've had a pretty wild ride professionally since graduating college. Most people find it very interesting so this is my attempt to lay out the highlights.

I graduated from high school in the year 2000 and went to Temple University
as a film major with aspirations to work in the video game industry. After
graduating college I lived in China for a year teaching English and building
a 3D design portfolio.

In 2006 I moved to San Diego with a suit case and a job that paid $9/hour. I began working at THQ Wireless as a cell phone video game tester. It was a lot of fun! I had plans to establish myself as a valuable resource and shop my portfolio around. With the launch of the original iPhone and the economic collapse, THQ Wireless shut its doors and the whole company later went bankrupt. I held on as long as I could but in 2009 I decided to move home to the Philadelphia area where I had a stronger network and family roots.

In 2010 I shifted gears and began working for The Vanguard Group in their call center. This was a substantial departure from the direction I saw my life going, but I had many friends happy at this company. I took advantage of their academic assistance program almost immediately. After taking 60 - 80 phone calls a day helping investors prepare themselves for the best possible chance of investment success, I took night classes at a local Penn State campus working towards a Master's in Information Science.

By 2012 I was software testing for one of the accounting departments at Vanguard. Two years after that I wrapped up my Master's degree and began working as an Enterprise System Admin focusing on the Windows platform. The business knowledge and customer service skills I had developed during my stint in the call center proved to be very valuable here and a unique trait. I specialized in our filesharing, FTP, and proxy environments. My technical accument and troubleshooting skills developed quickly.

In 2016 I began working on our cloud initiative doing operational support and learning and providing an extra set of hands where needed for windows engineering tasks. In 2017 I accepted a role full time as a Windows Cloud Infrastructure Engineer.

See I told you, pretty wild!
