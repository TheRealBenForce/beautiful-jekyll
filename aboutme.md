title: About me

Hi, my name is Ben Force. That is my real name. I like nerdy things such
as video games, cloud computing, and fish keeping.

### My blog
This is a serverless static website built on Amazon S3, secured with Amazon Certificate Manager, distributed globally with CloudFront, fronted by Route53, version controlled in GitHub, and pipelines with AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuld. Sounds complicated but it's built from entirely from CloudFormation and available in my [github repo s3plus](https://github.com/TheRealBenForce/s3plus). All you have to do is make the blog!

Currently my buildspec supports Jekyll. I'm using the [beautiful-jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

### My crazy professional history
I've had a pretty wild ride professionally since graduating college. Most people find it very interesting so this is my attempt to lay out the highlights.

I graduated from high school in the year 2000 and went to Temple University
as a film major with aspirations to work in the video game industry. After
graduating college I lived in China for a year teaching English and building
a 3D design portfolio.

In 2006 I moved to San Diego with a suit case and a job that paid $9/hour. I began working at THQ Wireless as a cell phone video game tester. It was a lot of fun! I had plans to establish myself as a valuable resource and shop my portfolio around. With the launch of the original iPhone and the economic collapse, THQ Wireless shut its doors and the whole company later went bankrupt. I held on as long as I could but in 2009 I decided to move home to the Philadelphia area where I had a stronger network and family roots.

In 2010 I shifted gears and began working for The Vanguard Group in their call center. This was a substantial departure from the direction I saw my life going, but I had many friends happy at this company. I took advantage of their academic assistance program almost immediately. After taking 60 - 80 phone calls a day helping investors prepare themselves for the best possible chance of investment success, I took night classes at a local Penn State campus working towards a Master's in Information Science.

By 2012 I was software testing for one of the accounting departments at Vanguard. Two years after that I wrapped up my Master's degree and began working as an Enterprise System Admin focusing on the Windows platform. The business knowledge and customer service skills I had developed during my stint in the call center proved to be very valuable here and a unique trait. I specialized in our filesharing, FTP, and proxy environments. My technical accument and troubleshooting skills developed quickly.

In 2016 I began working on our cloud initiative doing operational support and learning and providing an extra set of hands where needed for windows engineering tasks. In 2017 I accepted a role full time as a Windows Cloud Infrastructure Engineer.

See I told you, pretty wild!
